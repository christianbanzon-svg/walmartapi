The tourmaline ceramic coated plates provide even heat to minimize damage for less frizz and shiny, healthy-looking hair. With 15-second heat-up to an ultra-high 455 degrees F (230 degrees C) and variable heat settings, this professional-quality hair straightener lets you style quickly and efficiently. No more waiting around for your hair straightener or flat iron to heat up! It reaches high enough heat to turn even the most out-of-control hair into shiny, smooth, and soft tresses. Extra-long floating plates make it easy to style quickly and you can even use it to create wavy curls with a flick of your wrist. Tourmaline ceramic technology provides both anti-frizz and anti-static results with less damage than other traditional straightening irons.
