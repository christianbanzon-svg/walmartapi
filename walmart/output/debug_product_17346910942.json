From half-wet to Dry, we use directional airflow to comb and straighten the hair, truly achieving blow-dry straightening, which does not damage hair, and creates naturally straight hair. Let your hair blow dry rather than bake.\n * Long-lasting Hair Care: IG INGLAM's independently developed IG-IQ intelligent temperature control technology monitors the air outlet temperature at high frequency. It can monitor the airflow temperature 100 times/second and maintain the temperature difference of each setting at 41°F/5°C. Make the hair care process safer. We also have a built-in negative ion emitter, which continuously emits 200 million negative ions during use, truly achieving skin-care-grade hair care.\n * Safety and After-Sales Guarantee: The flat iron for hair meets U.S. safety requirements and proudly features the ETL Certification seal.",
